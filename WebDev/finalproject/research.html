        Our team of independent scientists and researchers uncovered this alarming reality through months of field investigations, data analysis, and forensic examinations of decommissioned train cars. Hidden cameras, laser-based tracking systems, and covert audio recorders were discovered embedded in various components of the rail infrastructure—devices often disguised or encrypted to avoid detection. This research exposes how trains have been weaponized against the public under the guise of safety and efficiency, and raises urgent questions about civil liberties, data privacy, and the growing reach of government surveillance.
